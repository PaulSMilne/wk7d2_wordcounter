A project to make a simple mobile app of a word counter - to type in a string of words and say back how many words are in.

I spent over an hour at Codeclan setting up some of the files and doing a CountWord java class that does the basic calculations. I then created a Word Counter class file to run the app. I've been checking the files in the EightBall app to work out how they all fit together and where to make changes for the different app.
